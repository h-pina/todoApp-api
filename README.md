# Project Description

  This project is meant to be a way for me to train some new concepts, methodologies and tools Ive recently discovered and started learning. Because of this, most of it probably wont be optimal code (maybe some of it wont even be efficient), since this is not the goal. I'll mainly approach its develop as a playground rather than a product, so I'll do a lot of experimentation

# Objectives

 - Build a RESTful API using ASP NET Core
 - Implement all CRUD operations (at least one of each)
 - Develop the wwhole project using a TDD methodology (probably with xUnit)
 - Implement a CI/CD
 - Dockerize the project

# Restrictions
  - This project has to be developed in 1 weeks max
  -
